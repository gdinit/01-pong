// GENERAL / MISC
- Try to get as close as possible to 100% uncrustify enforcing - as it works every single time 24/7/365.
- Use tabs to indent, not spaces. Tabs are 8-character long.
- Use Every single condition MUST be braced, like so:
	unless (q) return;	/* NOT OK */
	unless (q)
		return;		/* not OK "}" */
	unless (q) {		/* OK */
		return;
	}


// FILENAMES
- source code filenames end in .cc
- header filenames end in .h
- inline filenames end in .inl
- filenames do not contain '-' or '_' between words.	e.g.: ingamemenustate.cc


// NAMING, CASING
- Do use PascalCasing for class names		e.g.: class InGameMenuState : public State
- Prefix class data member names with "m_".		e.g.: m_memberName
- Use all upper case for configuration definitions. (defined in 'config.h' and used everywhere).		e.g.: CONFIG_DESIRED_FPS_INT
- Do use camelCasing for member variables:	
- Do use camelCasing for parameters
- Do use camelCasing for local variables
- Do use camelCasing for function names


// COMMENTS
- All comments should be above the code. Never on the right side, never after the code. 
  Note: there are still right-side comments, standardization WIP!
- Do note that Javadocs and Doxygen style are also catering to automatic generation of documentation in mind. What they encouraged is usually fine.
- Code Complete advice:
	* Comments should describe why, not what you are doing
	* Comments should be in a form easy to maintain and type out. No fanciful ascii header and art please!
