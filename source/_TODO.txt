// MISSING ---------------------------------------------------------------------
-add collision detection and response: bounce back from paddles (with bounce direction slight randomization)
-add collision detection and response: goal from left & right sides
-add scoring system [detect goal + update scoreboard]
-sound	1. collision sound 2. goal sound
-add version information to the main menu and pause screen
-menus
	-main menu	start a new game, options
	-options menu	resolution, full screen on/off, mute on/off, sound level 0 - 20 steps. key bindings (display / change)
-demo play AI vs AI on launch
-add side indicator with "computer" & "human" icons
-add visual aid: on round start (as a reminder) show the currently active control keys
-add a video intro using black & white original programmers demonstrating the game
-create a credits screen, auto text scroll
-add original programmer name & picture to credits screen
-add technical consultants to credits screen

// KNOWN ISSUES ----------------------------------------------------------------
-when a movement key is held down, after ~1 second, movement speed slows down & object shakes
-FPS sometimes shows 10000000. perhaps "if stateAge is young, and observedFPS is too high" we should just discard it?


// ENHANCEMENT -----------------------------------------------------------------
-add ability to toggle FullScreen at runtime (F11)
-in the intro picture, make the Pong on the computer screen look like the real one
-add pong namespace in every file
-add std everywhere and lose the `using namespace std` at top of each file
-wrap all if(debug)s in ifdefs & use a master on/off switch in config.h


/ FIXED / COMPLETED / DONE / CANCELLED ------------------------------------------
+on introstate, when Q is pressed game quits as expected but then it respawns a second instance! (pressing Q 2nd time terminates successfully)
	^^ this is happening on Windows and it is not an issue on Mac!
+game paused screen fps calculation not running
-when you quickly pause/unpause the game, every time you pause/unpause, another 60fps is being added. 5x pause unpause accumulate 300fps
+reflection from bottom/top lines of screen
+move the debugOverlay, consoleDebug etc. to global bools
+in pausestate, simply put the GAME PAUSED text on top. keep the ball/paddles/score still visible.
+fix the shadow!
+paddles
+settings struct & SETTINGS global instance (thus game settings visible in every file)
+AI response logic
+when return to mainmenu ball is not destroyed & new round no ball!
+make Settings unique ptr
+change filenames to underscore standard
+scoreboard system, just two numbers --> leftPlayer & rightPlayer score
+comment out the debug couts everywhere
+there's a delay between keypress and initial movement of playerPaddle
+need to calc magnitute
+cleanup and complete newround initial random throw target on new round code
+add random speed to newround initial random throw 
+add collision detection and response: bounce back from top/bottom (without bounce direction randomization)
